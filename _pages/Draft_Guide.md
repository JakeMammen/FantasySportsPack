Welcome to the 2025 Fantasy Sports Pack Draft Guide. A couple things to keep in mind before we get started. The following will be based off 10-team leagues, Points Per Reception (PPR) scoring format, and the standard team structure of 1 QB, 2 RB, 2 WR, 1 flex, 1 TE, 1 D/ST, and 1 K. My goal is to provide several ideas and techniques on how you can approach your drafts. Regardless of whether it's a 10-team league or not, the same approach can be used universally across larger team league formats. However, we need to keep in mind that for each team added the value and demand of players moves up.

Now that we have that out of the way, let's talk Fantasy Football. Fantasy Football has been around for many years and over the last few years it has grown very popular. In fact, there are more and more fantasy football contests, leagues, and formats being introduced each year. Why bring that up, well as the years have gone on, the fantasy community has grown smarter. This means, more people, more fantasy football content going around, and overall the more savvy folks become. 

When it comes to building the perfect fantasy football draft strategy it's important to go into the draft prepared. In addition to the content, statistics, and data driven analysis you will find on this site, I recommend doing your own research and cross compare with other industry experts or sites. There may be ideas you take from here, but also other strategies you can take bits and pieces of from other analysts that can be paired together and used to your advantage. After doing this for several years I have found that there is no perfect strategy or amount of research that will make things go perfect or as planned. However, if we come prepared then when things go wrong we can have contingency plans. **Two big pieces of advice:** Always think multiple steps ahead and fantasy football is not a sprint it's a marathon.

## Fundamental Concepts
- Volume and opportunity are king in fantasy football
- Value based draft picks:
    * Average Draft Position (ADP) - based off ESPN, Underdog, Yahoo, etc. leagues
    * Rankings
    * Tiers
- Positional supply and demand

The above table I have to attribute to an idea Dwain McFarland of Fantasy Life created in 2024. When I came across it last year, I adopted the idea, used it in a few of my leagues, and found some success. The table has been modified slighty from the original to incorporate my thought process.
